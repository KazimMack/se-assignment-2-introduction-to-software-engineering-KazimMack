Assignment: Introduction to Software Engineering
Instructions:
Answer the following questions based on your understanding of software engineering concepts. Provide detailed explanations and examples where appropriate.

Questions:
Define Software Engineering:
 Is the systematic application of engineering principles and methods to the design, development, maintenance, testing, and evaluation of software and systems that make software useful and functional.
What is software engineering, and how does it differ from traditional programming?

Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC):
 Is a structured process that helps software developers to create high-quality software without leaving any single phase or stage of meeting the standard and quality of software which meets or exceeds customer expectations. 
Explain the various phases of the Software Development Life Cycle. Provide a brief description of each phase.
 Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC) has 6 phase in developing a software: 
 1. Requirements - Here is all about gathering information and documents that users and system need based on requirements. 
 2. Design - In this pahse the developer create and design the software user interface (UI) and architecture in detailed manner so that he meet the user expectation. 
 3. Implementation - Here the developer write down the code of the software based on the design specification and user interface. 
 4. Testing - Testing its all about making an assurance that the designed software meets the quality and standards and functionality requirement of the software. 
 5. Deployment - The software developer in this phase release the software to the user, customer or clients. 
 6. Maintenance - The developer in this stage provide support and update and enhancement of software and to cover all challenge to the user that face or experience after deployment.
Agile vs. Waterfall Models:
 Waterfall models - Is the models that follow linear sequence as step by steps as each phase has to be completed before the next one begin. Agile - Is an iterative and incremental approach to software development. It emphasizes flexibility, collaboration, customer feedback, and rapid delivery of functional software.

Compare and contrast the Agile and Waterfall models of software development. What are the key differences, and in what scenarios might each be preferred?
 .1. Approach 
 - Waterfall: Linear and sequential While Agile: Iterative and incremental. 
 2. Flexibility 
 - Waterfall: Inflexible to changes once the development process starts while Agile: Highly adaptable to changes throughout the development process. 
 3. Documentation 
 - Waterfall: Extensive documentation for each phase while Agile: Less emphasis on documentation, more on working software and customer feedback.
 4. Risk Management 
 - Waterfall: Risk management is done early in the project while Agile: Continuous risk management throughout the development cycle. 
 5. Customer Involvement 
 - Waterfall: Limited involvement after the requirements phase while Agile: Continuous involvement and feedback.
 6. Delivery 
- Waterfall: Software is delivered at the end of the project while Agile: Functional software is delivered frequently in iterations. Agile and Waterfall models both of this suitable to use but depend on the project nature as how they both differ in flexibility and continuous improvement, while the other one provides a structured and clear path to project completion.
Requirements Engineering:

What is requirements engineering? Describe the process and its importance in the software development lifecycle.
Requirements engineering is the process of identifying, analyzing, specifying, validating, and managing the needs and expectations of stakeholders for a software system. Here are the requirement engineeering process 
1. Requirements Elicitation:In this process the developer collect all the details and information from the client or stakeholder and most to the developer he/she can do like an interview, questionaire, survey etc.
2. Requirements Analysis: The analization of information and collected requirement  to make sure clarity and completeness are done properly with no error and mistakes. Forexample priotize requirements and feasibility studies.
3. Requirements Specification: In this process the developer he/she make a specification of a requirement in clear and detailed manner so that to identify fictional and not fictional requirements.
4. Requirements Validation: Ensure that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are feasible.
5. Requirements Management: Manage changes to the requirements throughout the software development lifecycle. 
Requirement Engineering is crucial to the success of software development projects lifecycle for several reasons:
1. Quality Assurance
2. Stakeholder Satisfaction
3. Changes Management with Accuracy
4. Risk Management
5. Reduce and managing cost and time

Software Design Principles:

Explain the concept of modularity in software design. How does it improve maintainability and scalability of software systems?
Modularity in software design refers to the practice of dividing a software system into distinct, self-contained units or modules, each of which is responsible for a specific piece of functionality. 
1. Improved Maintainability:
When a system is modular, changes in one module do not affect others, as long as the interface contracts are maintained. This isolation makes it easier to update, debug, and enhance individual modules without risking the stability of the entire system.
2.  Enhanced Scalability:
Modularity enables different teams to work on different modules concurrently, facilitating faster development cycles and more efficient resource utilization. This parallelism is crucial for scaling development efforts.

Testing in Software Engineering:

Describe the different levels of software testing (unit testing, integration testing, system testing, acceptance testing). Why is testing crucial in software development?  
Software testing is a critical process in software development, ensuring that the software functions as intended, meets requirements, and is free from defects. The software has different level of testing as discussed below.
1. Unit Testing:
Unit testing involves testing individual components or modules of the software in isolation. Each unit is tested independently to ensure that it performs as expected.
2.  Integration Testing:
Integration testing focuses on the interactions between integrated units/modules to ensure they work together correctly.
3. System Testing:
System testing involves testing the complete, integrated system to verify that it meets the specified requirements.
4. Acceptance Testing:
Acceptance testing is conducted to determine whether the software is ready for delivery by verifying that it meets the business requirements and is acceptable to the end-users.
All of this level and steps in testing the software has more crucial reasons in doing it not for developer him/herself but also to the user as well as client/stakeholder.
1. Meeting Requirements
2. Ensuring Quality and Reliability
3. Improving Performance
4. Boosting User Satisfaction and Expectation
5. Facilitating Maintenance and Upgrades (To have a better control for the new version)
Software testing is an essential part of the software development lifecycle, encompassing various levels such as unit testing, integration testing, system testing, and acceptance testing. Each level serves a specific purpose, from verifying individual components to validating the entire system against user requirements, needs and expectation.

Version Control Systems:

What are version control systems, and why are they important in software development? Give examples of popular version control systems and their features.
Version Control System are the system that help the developer to be able to control and manage changes of a software from time to time as well as keeping track of every modification he/she make in a software. Version Control System has some more importatnt in software development.
1. Collaboration and Team Coordination - This allow multiple developer to work in one or same project at once.
2. History Management - Keep tracking of software changes to a code base in daily basis and who made changes of a software.
3. Backup and Recovery - If a local machine fails, the code is still safe in the remote repository because the repository serves as a backup of the codebase.
Popular Version Control System
1. Git:
> Distributed version control system.
> Popular due to its flexibility, performance, and powerful branching and merging capabilities.
> Platforms: GitHub, GitLab, Bitbucket.
2. Perforce:
